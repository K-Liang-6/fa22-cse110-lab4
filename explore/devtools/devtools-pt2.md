1. The bug should come from data types. The code should compute the sum of two integers value instead of two string value sum. But in the code, it passes
   two string to calculate the sum. That leads to a bug with a wrong output.

2. Use parseInt() function in the calculateSum to read the two inputs as integers and add the two ints, then it will gives the correct output.
